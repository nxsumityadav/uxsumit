                    "The design journey for Referral Stack began with a commitment to deeply understand the real challenges faced by SaaS teams, digital creators, and affiliate marketers in managing referral and affiliate programs. I initiated the process by conducting comprehensive stakeholder interviews, engaging with both business owners and end users across a spectrum of company sizes and industries. Through these conversations, I uncovered that over 80% of participants struggled with manual tracking and payout processes, while 65% expressed frustration with delayed or inaccurate payments—pain points that consistently hindered their ability to scale and trust their affiliate programs.",
                    "To further ground our approach, I meticulously mapped user journeys for each primary persona: SaaS founders who needed to launch programs quickly, marketers who required granular analytics, and affiliates who prioritized transparent, timely payouts. By synthesizing these findings, I developed detailed personas and user stories that highlighted not only operational bottlenecks but also the emotional toll of unreliable tools—feelings of frustration, lack of control, and missed growth opportunities."

                content: "Next, I turned to the competitive landscape, conducting an in-depth benchmarking exercise against leading platforms such as PromoteKit, ReferralCandy, Tolt, and Rewardful. The analysis revealed several critical gaps: competitors often required 20–60 minutes for setup, lacked seamless PayPal integration, and offered only basic or manual fraud prevention. Most platforms also failed to provide a unified, modern interface or support for dark and light modes, which are increasingly expected by today’s users. These insights directly informed our product priorities, pushing us to differentiate Referral Stack with instant onboarding (under 10 minutes), robust PayPal and Stripe support, real-time automated fraud detection, and a flexible design system."

Both dark and light modes were meticulously crafted to accommodate user preferences and accessibility needs. Every aspect of the design system was thoroughly documented, enabling seamless collaboration and alignment across engineering, product, and marketing teams. This approach significantly reduced design-developer friction, accelerating our build cycles and ensuring pixel-perfect implementation."
